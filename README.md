# This code was developed by the Mayer Lab at University of Toledo by Ryan Brown (principal investigator: Christine M. Mayer) to improve accuracy of the Sandusky River grass carp population model. Previously, a set sampling distance was used in the model based off gear and protocols used in the field. However, sampling distances vary considerably by gear and protocol and this code helps account for that variability, allowing for increased accuracy of the model. This code uses shapefiles of starting and ending sampling points along with a shapefile of the river/stream research is being conducted on. Accurate river polylines are essential for the proper functioning of this code and all shapefiles used must be in the projected coordinate system.
